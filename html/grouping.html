                        <p class="PageContent">Grouping requirements is an important step when evaluating new technology as a Product Manager. Different
                        types of requirements are important to different stakeholders in different situations. For example, infrastructure requirements, such as
                        something like enterprise server software compatbility (e.g. websphere versus weblogic) is a different type of requirement than ones
                        important to your users (e.g. ability to perform a global search from any page). Grouping allows you to keep track of all this
                        and know who to go to for which sets of requirements and satisfy the individual needs of different stakeholder groups.</p>
                        <p class="PageContent">TSRM makes grouping easy by allowing you to create new groupings and edit existing ones at any time in the
                        process. It also allows you to easily move requirements between groupings as the evaluation process evolves.</p>
                        <p class="PageContent">Grouping requirements is not required in TSRM. While uncommon, when selecting very simple or enabling technology
                        sometimes requirements stand on their own. Groupings can help in our next step when we weight requirements (or groupings, or both).
                        For example weighting the user requirements group at 50% and the infrastructure or technical requirements at 20% may be appropriate
                        for organizations that have a large appetite for satisfying users and are willing to pay for the technical debt.</p>
