                <p class="PageContent">TSRM is an application made for busy product managers. It makes evaluating new technology investments, acquisitions, etc
                easier than ever. TSRM allows product managers to throwout ugly excels with complicated formulas that are time consuming to create and
                manage; freeing up the Product Managers time to focus on the user and stakeholder needs. It is also more profsssional looking, easier
                [for executives and clients] to follow, more trasnparent in scoring and weighting, and easy to adapt as things change throughout the
                technology evaluation and selection process!</p>
