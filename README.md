# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For project 0 I began working on what I want to evolve in to a technology or software selection evaluation app for product managers.
As a product manager, anytime we face a build or buy decision on a new piece of technology my real job of making economic-value and usability decisions gets
convoluted with mexplaining why we went with certain requirements, stakeholders bickering over the importance (weight) of their requirements, executives
questioing our thought process, and unclear, difficult to update, and messy matrices.

While this phase of the app development just provides explanations of the three primary features, as we continue in to python, JS, and SQL, I want to actually
develop a web-app that can be used to easily enter, arrange and group, and then weight requirements and overall groupings to simplify this important
task and communication tool that product managers and other technology deciders user.
